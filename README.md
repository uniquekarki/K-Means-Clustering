# K-Means Clustering Image Segmentation
K-Means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised algorithm and it is used to segment the interest area from the image. It clusters, or partitions the given data into K-clusters or parts based on the K-centroids. In this case I have taken 7 clusters to segment the image.

## Requirements:
```
1. OpenCV
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
```
## How to run:
1. Fist save the image you want to segment as `Input.jpg`.
2. Run `k-means.py` file to process `Input.jpg`. The resulting image is saved as `Result.jpg`.
